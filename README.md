SMYAYA for iOS
===========

SMYAYA is a simple iOS application to display information that is relevant to a group such as a class, club, or church ministry. The app itself is an empty stage. A schema (consisting of menu items, a newsfeed, and geolocation pins) is the collection of items you put on that stage. Schemas can be created with the Scheme-builda page which is also open sourced and included in this repo.

If you have any questions, create a new issue with specifics.

## Getting Started
No special steps required for the XCode project. Just download it and run it in XCode.

## Why is this open source?
What if we changed the whole way young people tapped into Church news? Proudly presenting: the SMYAYA App, a tool that lets everybody instantly share their ministries, clubs, and classes with iOS users. Help us! Join the cause. Take away bugs. Add features. We have open sourced this app so that everyone can use it and so that everyone can make improvements to it. The only thing we seek is uncompromising quality. Along the way, we encountered many forks in the road and always opted for the harder road if it meant a better quality product in the end. This is encouraged for all contributions.

## License
Any code written for this project by staff of St. Marys churches is released into the public domain. This would include code for the web server assets such as schema builder which was written by John Amoratis. 

The specific Objective C code for this app was written by Chris Dollinger who is not a staff member. This is his code written as a volunteer source code contributor, and he has released it all under the GNU GPL license. [GNU GPL License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

If you make a derivative app from this code, please make substantial changes and improvements.

## Contributing
If you want to fix bugs or implement new features, have at it! All that I ask is that you make proper attributions. If you make something spiffy, send it over, I'd love to see it! Keep those pull requests coming!


## Possible improvements
UI feedback that schema has been successfully downloaded

Protocol helper such as smyaya:// for download links to schemas that would directly open the app and start the download even if the link for a new schema was tapped in an e-mail

List of recently used schemas to facilitate switching back and forth

Schema builder baked right into the app itself
